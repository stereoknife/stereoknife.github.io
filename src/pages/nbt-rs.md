My current project for trying to learn Rust, and currently very early in development. Nbt-rs is a library and terminal application for reading, manipulating, and writing Named Binary Tag files used in the game Minecraft. The plan is to use this in a bigger (one of the few pointful ideas in here) project but that's a thing for later when this is working reliable.
