Cowbot is a Discord bot that does silly things like query youtube videos, translate messages, or drop random verses from the bible. Cowbot is written in Haskell using the howdy and discord-haskell libraries.

Howdy is a custom made very messy high level Discord library written on top of discord-haskell. It provides a simple API to register commands and handles all the magic behind the scenes.

More info on how they're built and how to run them in their repos:
