I needed to prove I can do web development with all the buzzwords, but I didn't want to send tons of unnecessary javascript for a site with unchanging content. Truly a conundrum for the ages, until I figured I can use **Astro** to build websites using any modern **component based**, **reactive** frontend framework and **prerender** them at build time for **fully optimized**, **no-javascript**, **lightning-fast** plain HTML and CSS delivery.
