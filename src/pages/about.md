My name is Ignasi Granell. I'm a full-stack developer, Unity developer, and pretty much anything that seems neat or interesting deverloper (these days it's Haskell and Rust!). I have most experience with Unity (particularly VR), and web development with Vue and React, but I've also built and deployed services with Docker Compose and system administration of FreeBSD and Ubuntu servers.

Some of the personal stuff I've done is on my Github page, unfortunately projects related to my job are protected under an NDA.
